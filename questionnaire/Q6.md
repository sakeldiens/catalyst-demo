# Q6. Linux system

Your workstation reports that the disk is full. What commands would you use to investigate. What would you do if the commands report that there are still enough blocks available on your disks.

# Answer

## Disk Full

Check disk usage:

```
df -h --total
```

Check disk usage grouped by users:

```
du -sh /home/*
```

Check inode usage:

```
df -i
```

Check for any large directories:

```
du -h --max-depth=1
```

## Enough Blocks available

Inconsitent disk reports might be a file system that is corrupt. Check for any file system corruption and repair it:

```
umount /dev/nvm0n1p1
fsck /dev/nvm0n1p1
```

Check for any processes holding on to deleted jobs, identify it and kill it:

```
lsof | grep deleted
kill -9 <process_id>
```

Identify directories with an unexpected amount of small files:

```
sudo find / -xdev -type f | cut -d "/" -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
```

Check the percentage of each inode usage:

```
df -1
```
