# Q4. Quality assurance

Describe a situation where you think Behaviour Driven Development could be a particularly good or bad approach to a software project.

# Answer

## Good

Since the focus of BDD is on the effort of discovering and delivering features that are necessary and aligned with the project's business goals, and the solution is provided in a way that is useful to the business, one benefit is that it reduces **waste** and **costs**. Waste is the time associated with the delays in redesigning and rewriting the code in order to produce the correct feature, and cost is obviously the extra money spent on the time it will take to complete.

## Bad

Higher maintenance costs on automated tests can result from poorly designed and written test cases. Additionally, code lacking in proper abstraction levels for these tests could become quite challenging to maintain, especially for complex web applications.
