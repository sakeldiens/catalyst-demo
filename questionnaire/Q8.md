# Q8. VCS

You accidentally commit some secrets to a git repository. Describe the steps to revert that change. Discuss any possible issues with it.

# Answer

### Prerequisites

Install Git Filter repo:

```
sudo apt install git-filter-repo
```

### Remove sensitive data

Clone the repository:

```
git clone catalyst-proj
cd catalyst-proj
```

Remove the **secret file** from the commit history:

```
git filter-repo --path <path_to_secret_file> --invert-paths --force
```

### Rewrite History

To ensure a reference to the remote repository with the correct URL, add the repository as a remote and push the changes:

```
git remote add origin <your_repo_url>
```

### Force Push

Push the changes forcefully.

```
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

### Modify Secret and Send Notifications

Change and rotate secrets.
Notify anyone affected by the leak.

### Preventive Measure

To prevent any sensitive data being leaked through accidental commits, add them to a .gitignore file:

```
echo 'path/to/secret' >> .gitignore
```
