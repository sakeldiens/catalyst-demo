# Q5. Infrastructure

## 1. How would you ensure that your production platform is kept up to date with security patches? 

By regularly checking for latest updates via package managers, or/and automate live updates with Ubuntu's LivePatch.


## 2. Describe how you would help a customer to create an application deployment process that was appropriate to their needs.

Explain to the custom that the best way to deploy a PHP application is to set up a CI/CID pipeline.

### Assumptions:
* Code resides in GitHub
* Completed testing of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. 
* Script is included in composer.json that runs the tests.


### GitHub

1. Create a Workflow for GitHub Actions
* Create a file called ci.yml in the .github/workflows directory on GitHub.
2. Sample file under app_deplyment/.github/workflows
3. Add a deployment file in GitHub Actions (see build_test_deploy.yaml)
4. Secure the deployment by adding your credentials to the secret: Private_key, Host, Username, etc.
5. 

## 3. Which functions of a common web platform might one choose to offload to a Content Delivery Network, and when?

* AWS S3 (URL not SEO friendly) and Cloudfront functions.
* You would normally want to offload to a CDN when your site reaches a large international audience, and one server can't manage to handle multiple simultaneous requests for mostly static files, i.e. streaming video, audio, PDFs, images etc.
